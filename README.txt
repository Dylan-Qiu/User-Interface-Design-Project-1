Please open the index.html file with a browser, type in search information like song name to the corresponding box and click on the search button. Clicking on the PLAY button will play the music and PAUSE button will pause playing. If there are more than 10 results, there is a button called next ten results at the end of the page, which would direct you to the next ten results.

If there is no result found, websites would give feedback, saying there are no results based on the search, fewer keywords are expected. This keeps user informed of web pages' status.

If results are not specific enough, user could add more keywords without retyping old keywords, which keeps efficiency.

Year filter could be given a range of years since sometimes, user canâ€™t remember exact year of the song, which gives user flexibility.

Search bar is on the left side and results are on the right side, this is for full use of the screen.
